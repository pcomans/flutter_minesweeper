# Flutter Upgrade Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for upgrading Flutter to the latest version (3.32.0). The current workspace contains a Flutter project that appears to be using very old versions of Flutter and dependencies. This plan covers the upgrade process, potential challenges, and step-by-step implementation.

## Current State Analysis

### Project Assessment
- **Current Project**: Minesweeper Flutter app
- **Current State**: No Flutter SDK installed, very old dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Using outdated packages like `cupertino_icons: ^0.1.0`
- **Dart SDK**: No version constraint specified in pubspec.yaml
- **Platform**: Linux 6.12.8+

### Latest Flutter Information
- **Latest Flutter Version**: 3.32.0 (released approximately 1 week ago)
- **Current Dart SDK**: 3.8.0 (bundled with Flutter 3.32.0)
- **Previous Stable**: 3.24.0 (released August 2024)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Preparation

#### 1.1 Pre-Upgrade Checklist
- [ ] Backup current project state

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to upgrading Flutter to version 3.32.0. The plan addresses the current state of the project, identifies potential risks, and provides a clear roadmap for successful migration.

The key to success will be thorough testing at each phase and careful attention to breaking changes. Given the significant version jump from what appears to be a very old Flutter version, this upgrade should be treated as a major migration project.

Regular checkpoints and validation after each phase will ensure the upgrade process stays on track and any issues are identified and resolved early.
